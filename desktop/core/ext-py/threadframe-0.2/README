Obtaining tracebacks on other threads in Python
===============================================
by Fazal Majid (www.majid.info), 2004-06-10

David Beazley added advanced debugging functions to the Python interpreter,
and they have been folded into the 2.2 release. Guido van Rossum added in
Python 2.3 the thread ID to the interpreter state structure, and this allows
us to produce a dictionary mapping thread IDs to frames.

I used these hooks to build a debugging module that is useful when you
are looking for deadlocks in a multithreaded application. I've built
and tested this only on Solaris 8/x86, but the code should be pretty
portable.

Of course, I disclaim any liability if this code should crash your system,
erase your homework, eat your dog (who also ate your homework) or otherwise
have any undesirable effect.

Building and installing
=======================

Download threadframe-0.2.tar.gz. You can use the Makefile or the setup.py
script. There is a small test program test.py that illustrates how to use this
module to dump stack frames of all the Python interpreter threads. A sample
run is available for your perusal.
